My first test to print a sprite on the gba screen.

*REQUIREMENTS* :
- devkitpro (www.devkitpro.org) with gba toolchhain of course
- visual boy advance or n0ca$h gba
- the dream will be to have a AGB Device !!!!

*NOTE* :
To SQUIRE GROUP:
 => I've ripped your intro on the NDS, to have a sprite material for my test.
    I hope, you're not angry :op
 => Pacman sprite was in devoto pern project sample for gba. :)


*WARNiNG* :
The code won't compile if in your path contains some space.
